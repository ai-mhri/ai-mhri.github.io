# Welcome to AI-MHRI 
### The AI for Multimodal Human Robot Interaction Workshop at the Federated AI Meeting (FAIM) 2018 in Stockholm

The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has recently emerged as an intriguing technical and intellectual opportunity (e.g., in recent consecutive [AAAI Fall Symposia on AI-HRI in 2014, -15, -16, and -17](https://ai-hri.gihub.io)). Multimodal interaction with robots (M-HRI), including social signals (e.g., the Interspeech satellite workshop 'Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots' - [VIHAR-2017](http://vihar-2017.vihar.org)), can be also seen as an area within HRI that connects directly to various topics in AI. A full exploration of this intersection, however, has yet to be realized.  The aim of this 1.5 day workshop is to integrate fundamental insights that the AI community and the HRI community have to offer each other within this context.

We intend to frame the discussion by way of the complementary statements _HRI is an AI problem_ and _AI is an HRI problem_ and apply this mutual dependence to a range of relevant topics, including XAI, Planning, NLP, Machine Learning, Image Analysis, Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, (Multimodal) Dialogue, Gesture and Speech Recognition, and Autonomous Systems. In particular, the workshop will emphasize the specific AI and HRI challenges that arise from interacting with embodied agents like robots, as well as the interpretation and generation of social signals emerging from this interaction. Social signals can here refer to communicative modalities of robots and humans in direct interaction (as speech, gaze, or gesture), but it is also possible to view this term more broadly, including more general aspects of societal acceptance of technology, explainability and higher-level signals.

Our aim is to organise an actual _work_-shop rather than a mini-conference, with a focus on discussions around specific topics and areas, based on research area summaries and position papers. 


**A call for contributions and other details will be published here shortly.**
